# Python TDD

The goal is to improve one skills in testing especially in Python.

## Design

Always go for table based-unit testing, for me seeing the component of the test case on the top of the test help me to navigate what is the requirements, so we don't have straight jump into the detail of implementation of the unit test itself. see input and expected output and we go from there.

## Useful Library

- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html}
- [pytest-mock](https://pytest-mock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
