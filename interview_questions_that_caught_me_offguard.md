# Interview Questions That Caught Me Offguard

## Database Indexing

1. How does it works behind the scene? 

tl;dr it has a data structure behind it that can speed up the searching. more to be researched.

## Golang

1. Exact syntax for everything.

- goroutine, etc

## Javascript

1. Async vs Async/Await

- Async only will give you a promise object, while with Await will guarantee that you will have the expected value from that async operations.

## Microservices

1. Exact Definition

- It is an architecture pattern, so if the interviwer is asking some kind of case then keep clarifying until you have all the condition, making sure you don't get jumped with sudden requirement that can throw your off in high of tension.
- [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) - In software engineering, a microservice architecture is an architectural pattern that organizes an application into a collection of loosely coupled, fine-grained services that communicate through lightweight protocols. This pattern is characterized by the ability to develop and deploy services independently, improving modularity, scalability, and adaptability.
- The definition is quite loose, so need to be careful around this type of questions.
