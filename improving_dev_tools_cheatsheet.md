# Improving Dev tools cheatsheet

## Problem

You are coding with multiple languages, you frequently forget how certain languages does something, and you need some refresher. Stackoverflow or ChatGPT is good way, but it forces you to move to another windows, then have you search which tab is ChatGPT or google and then type the query "Python how to do this" which is quite a lot of steps. 

I want to improve some bit of that. 

## Key take away

There are these two tools: 

- [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)
- [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh/)

which seems the right direction to somehow decreses those steps, instead deciding whether to go with ChatGPT or Google, then jump to terminal, run the script to handle the query, and see what do you see...

if not found, then Google/ChatGPT it is as the problem will be more trivial.

## Constraint

The query need to be constrained how the tool can handle the topic, which can result in most of the thing you want to search is not there (yet). 

## Final thoughts

Need to try out the solutions, for few days or weeks and decide if this is really helpful. Because if your code is already built (like building something from the ground up) mostly you don't need to handle those snippets (I guesss (?)).
