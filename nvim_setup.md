# Neovim Setup

Need a more robust configuration for neovim, especially for coding tasks, improve workflows navigating projects.

## Mantra

There is nothing wrong with using vscode, but I want to find a better way to have my workspace limited to the terminal (Windows Terminal on Windows machine, Wezterm on my personal machine).

The idea is I don't want to keep repeating mysel with pressing atl+tab multiple times and missing out the windows I want to go. here's come the tmux and neovim combo. Which I will start on learning neovim and then improve again with tmux.
