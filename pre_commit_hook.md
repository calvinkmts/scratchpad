# Pre-commit Hook

## Experience 

### Good

- I can see the result of formatter and type checking (python) very fast.

### Awkward

- The pre-commit is run when I tried to do a git commit, if some of the hook failed making me do git add and then another git commit, which is awkward.

### Bad

- Not really for unit testing, especially for a monorepo designed project.
